Welcome to the homepage for the Statistical Consulting Program at the University of Chicago!

Here, you will find more information about our program, how to contact us and what to expect from our services and consultants. You will also find links to helpful resources, the consulting request form, as well as a way to look for and consult RA opportunities.

We are currently under the process of designing and expanding this website. Any feedback on useful resources to include and improvements to be made are welcome!



### Consulting Objectives
The Statistics Consulting workshop is an integral part of our graduate training. It combines the two following objectives: 
* Educational training of graduate students in Statistics (advanced Masters student and PhD sutdents), by providing them practical examples and applications of the methods that they are studying.
* Service to the community of the University of Chicago, by providing a free opportunity to ask for statistical guidance.
