title: 12/04/2015 Problems in Computational Biology  
---
**Presenter**: John Santerre  
**Topic**: Problems in Computational Biology  
**Abstract**: Computational Biology presents many problems that are computationally and statistically difficult.  Some are problems are hard due to combinatorial explosions while others are inferentially due to lack of information.  Scattered throughout this landscape is the reality that biology often uses strong simplifying assumptions that have statistics implications that often remain hidden without considerable collaboration. Touching on all three, this will be a rapid paced and broad talk that will review several major biological initiatives,  while connecting the the reality of a biologist's work flow to statistical approaches that could potentially further their analysis.  The intersection between sound statistics and the needs of real biologists will be stressed.  This work is funded by DOE and NIH multi-year projects with 20k biologists using our web tools.
