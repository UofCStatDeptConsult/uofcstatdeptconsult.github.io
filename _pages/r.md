The preferred software for performing statistical analysis is __R__, an open-source, free software that is vastly used by the scientific community to perform all sorts of analyses. If you are not familiar with __R__ and have to perform some flavour of data analysis, this language is definitely worth learning: the syntax is easy, and there are hundreds of additional libraries (~ which are like packages in Python) which will allow you to do your analysis swiftly and easily!

## Installing and Learning R

+ For additional help on installing __R__, read the [following instructions]({{ "" }}{% link _pages/installation.md %}). 
+ Here are a [few introductory slides]({{ "" }}{% link lectures/Lecture1_Intro.html %}) for understanding and getting started in R.
+ Our consultants have also started to put together a few resources for learning R. You can consult their tutorial by clicking on this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}images/tutorial-summary.html">link </a>.
