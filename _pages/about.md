Under the supervision of Statistics faculty members, our team of advanced graduate students and doctoral candidates offer __free statistical guidance__ to anyone within the University of Chicago Research community in areas such as:
*  Applied probability
* Hypothesis Testing
*  Statistical design, 
* Analysis of data, choice and application of statistical models, and interpretation of outputs,
* Statistical computation and simulation methods,
* Time series analysis,
* Interpretation of results, etc.

Consultation is available by appointment. __The clinic does not offer coding nor implementation help. Rather, it is an opportunity for members of the research community to efficiently seek help and advice with their own analyses.__ Additional help and closer collaborations by members of our group can also be arranged for adequate projects.

After your form is submitted, our consultants will be in touch via email to schedule your remote consulting appointment, to be conducted via a teleconferencing app such as Zoom. We aim to give an initial response within 24 hours, and to schedule an initial meeting within the same week your request is received.
