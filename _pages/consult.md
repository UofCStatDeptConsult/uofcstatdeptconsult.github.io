### Consulting: Modalities

+ __Registration:__
Students in the Department are required to sign-up and enroll for consulting for at least one or two quarters (or more if desired), depending on their program.  To ensure adequate enrolment during each quarter, PhD students will have to indicate and rank their preferred quarters for consulting at the beginning of the academic year.\\
*Requirements: 2 quarters for PhD year 1-3, 1 quarter for PhD year 4, 1 quarter for MS  (year 1 or 2).* 
+ __Participation:__
Registered students are required to attend the consulting seminar meetings in the quarter (Wednesdays at noon).\\
All other statistics graduate students are welcome to every consulting seminar meeting, as well as participating in any consulting projects.
+ __Consulting:__
In a quarter, consulting projects will be assigned to students registered for 44100 (no tuition involved).\\
Registered students are assigned to time slots as teams, based on availability and determined at the beginning of the quarter in the first consulting seminar meeting. \\
 For example, a team of four students may be responsible for taking care of all consulting appointments for a given time slot (eg, Wednesday 2-4 pm.) 
Researcher clients are asked to sign up to a time slot when submitting a consulting request. The student team responsible for the time slot will meet the clients at the time (in-person or over zoom).
The teams will discuss their consulting projects at the consulting seminar meeting on Wednesdays.\\
More in-depth collaborations with clients can be arranged for projects deemed adequate after the first initial meeting.
