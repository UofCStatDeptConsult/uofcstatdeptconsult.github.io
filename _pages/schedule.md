## Scheduling a Consult 

To schedule a consult with our team of consultants, please choose an appointment time from the widget below (or using [the following link](https://appt.link/stats-consultings-meetings-bg7fl48m/60-minute-meeting)) and fill in the form. __Make sure to use your UChicago affilated email address__ when completing the form, or we won't be able to schedule a meeting! 


After your form is submitted, our consultants will be in touch via email with the details for your remote consulting appointment, to be conducted via a teleconferencing app such as Zoom. We aim to give an initial response within 24 hours, and to schedule an initial meeting within the same week your request is received.

## Getting further help from our group

If you need further, or more extended help from our group, we offer the following options:
+ __Collaborate with a consulting group__: for adequate projects, we can put together a team of consultants that would be in charge of closely following your project. In this case, the consultants would provide help coding and implementing the analysis. Appropriate projects should include a challenging statistical methodological component, in order to qualify as part of our graduate training. To initiate such a collaboration, please sign up to the clinic first. The adequacy of your project to the "collaboration" format of our program will be determined during this initial meeting.
+ __Hire a research assistant__: we are compiling a list of students that have indicated being potentially interested in paid RAships. 


Please contact one of our workshop coordinators (Prof. Donnat or Prof Wang) to learn more about these opportunities.
