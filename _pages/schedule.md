## Scheduling a Consult

To schedule a consult with our team of consultants, please fill in [the following link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2HI1I-WUXgz71M67tPZ0AH3ClS0UjOCmnly_RcrjhX_vU0A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

After your form is submitted, our consultants will be in touch via email to schedule your remote consulting appointment, to be conducted via a teleconferencing app such as Zoom. We aim to give an initial response within 24 hours, and to schedule an initial meeting within the same week your request is received.


## Getting further help from our group

If you need further, or more extended help from our group, we offer the following options:
+ __Collaborate with a consulting group__: for appropriate projects, we can put together a team of consultants that would be in charge of closely following your project. Appropriate projects should include a challenging statistical methodological component, in order to qualify as part of our graduate training.
+ __Hire a research assistant__: we are compiling a list of students that have indicated being potentially interested in paid RAships. 


Please contact one of our workshop coordinators (Prof. Donnat or Prof Wang) to learn more about these opportunities.
