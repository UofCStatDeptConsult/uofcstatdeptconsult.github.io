# Exploratory data analysis

## What is exploratory data analysis (EDA)?

> There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable 
statistical routines. \ — Sir David Cox

EDA is an iterative process:

- Generate questions about your data
- Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling data

Use what you learn to refine your questions or generate new ones.

## Asking questions

Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data.

> EDA is fundamentally a creative process. And like most creative processes, 
the key to asking quality questions is to generate a large quantity of questions.[^1]

[^1]: (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#questions)

Two types of questions will always be useful for making
discoveries within your data:

1. What type of variation occurs within my variables?
1. What type of covariation occurs between my variables?

Some comments about EDA:

- It is not a formal process with a strict set of rules.
- Explore many ideas: some will pan out, others will be dead ends.
- Even if questions are predefined, quality of data still needs to be assessed



## Variation

**Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from 
measurement to measurement. Every variable has its own pattern of variation, 
which can reveal interesting information.[^2]

[^2]: (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html#variation)

Recall the `diamonds` dataset. Use a bar chart, to examine the distribution 
of a **categorical variable**, and a histogram that of a **continuous** one.

<div class="left" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```
</div>

<div class="right" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```
</div>


## Identifying typical values 

- Which values are the most common? Why?
- Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?
- Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?

```{r}
diamonds %>% filter(carat < 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```

Look for anything unexpected!

## Identify outliers

**Outliers** are observations that are unusual -- data points that don’t seem
to fit the general pattern. 

Sometimes outliers are data entry errors; other times outliers suggest important 
new science.

<div class="left" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5)
```

</div>

<div class="right" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50))
```
</div>

## Identifying outliers

Now that we have seen the usual values, we can try to understand them.

```{r}
diamonds %>% filter(y < 3 | y > 20) %>% 
  select(price, carat, x, y, z) %>% arrange(y)
```


The y variable measures the length (in mm) of one of the three dimensions 
of a diamond.

Therefore, these must be entry errors! Why?

It’s good practice to repeat your analysis with and without the outliers.


## Covariation

**Covariation** is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary 
together in a related way.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=carat, y=price), alpha=0.1) 
```


## Boxplots 

**Boxplot** are used to display visual shorthand for a distribution of 
a continuous variable broken down by categories. 

They mark the distribution's quartiles.

## A categorical and a continuous variable

Use a boxplot or a violin plot to display the covariation between a 
categorical and a continuous variable.

**Violin plots** give more information, as they show the entrire estimated
distribution.

<div class="left" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(
  x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()
```
</div>

<div class="right" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(
  x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy)) +
  geom_violin() + coord_flip()
```

</div>

## Two categorical variables

To visualise the **covariation between categorical variables**, you need to 
count the number of observations for each combination, e.g. using `geom_count()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = color))
```

## 

Another approach is to first, compute the count and then visualise it 
by coloring with `geom_tile()` and the fill aesthetic:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>%  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n)) +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```

## Two continuous variables

<div class="left" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  scale_y_log10() + scale_x_log10() 
```

</div>

<div class="right" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
# install.packages("hexbin")
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_hex(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  scale_y_log10() + scale_x_log10() 
```

</div>

# Interactive graphics

## The `plotly` package

> - `plotly` is **a package for visualization** 
and a collaboration platform for data science
> - Available in **R, python, MATLAB, scala**.  
> - You can produce **interactive graphics including 3D plots**
(with zooming and rotating).
> - You can open a **'plotly' account ** to upload 'plotly' graphs 
  and view or modify them in a web browser.
> - Resources: [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf), 
[book](https://plotly-book.cpsievert.me)

## `plotly` integration with `ggplot2`

```{r plotly-ggplot2}
library(plotly); library(tidyverse) # or library(ggplot2); library(dplyr)
plt <- ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_n(1000), aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = cut))
ggplotly(plt) 
```


##

```{r plotly-ggplot2-facet}
plt <- ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_n(1000), aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = clarity), size = 4) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(color = cut, fill = cut)) +
  facet_wrap(~cut)
ggplotly(plt) 
```


## 3D Scatter plots

```{r plotly-scatter3D}
theta <- seq(0, 10, 0.2); 
df <- data.frame(U = theta, V =  cos(theta), W = sin(theta)*theta)
plot_ly(df, x = ~V, y = ~W, z = ~U, type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers",
        marker = list(size = 3))
```

##

```{r plotly-scatter3D-col, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df$cols <- rep_len(c("orange", "blue", "green"), length.out = length(theta))
(plt <- plot_ly(df, x = ~V, y = ~W, z = ~U, color = ~cols,
        type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers+lines",
        marker = list(size = 5), line = list(width = 5)))
```


## Adding layers

```{r plotly-scatter3D-layer}
dbl.helix <- data.frame(t = rep(seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100), 3)) %>%
  mutate(x1 = sin(t), y1 = cos(t), z = (1:length(t))/10,
         x2 = sin(t + pi/2), y2 = cos(t + pi/2))
plot_ly(dbl.helix, x = ~x1, y = ~y1, z = ~z, type = "scatter3d", mode = "lines", 
        color = "green", colors = c("green", "purple"), line = list(width = 5)) %>% 
  add_trace(x = ~x2, y = ~y2, z = ~z+0.2, color = "purple") 
```

## Volcano dataset

* **`volcano`** - a built-in dataset storing topographic information 
for Maunga Whau (Mt Eden), one of 50 volcanos in Auckland, New Zealand.
* It consist of a 87 x 61 matrix with entries corresponding to the mountain's 
atlitutes [m] on a 10m by 10m grid.  
* rows run east to west, and columns south to north

```{r print-volcano}
dim(volcano)
volcano[1:5, 1:5]
``` 

## 2D contour plots

```{r plotly-contour2D}
plot_ly(z = volcano) %>% add_contour()
```

## 3D surface plots

```{r plotly-surf3D}
plot_ly(z = volcano) %>% add_surface()
```
