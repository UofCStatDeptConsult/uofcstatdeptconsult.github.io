# Data Manipulation


## The `purr` package

Package `purrr` is part of the `tidyverse`. Handles tasks similar to
ones performed by apply-family functions in base R.

It enhances R’s functional programming toolkit by providing a
complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and
vectors.
`map`-functions allow you to replace many for loops with code that is easier 
to read.

- `map()`, `map_if()`, `map_at()` returns a list
- `map_lgl()` returns a logical vector, 
- `map_int()` returns a integer vector,
- `map_dbl()` returns a double vector, 
- `map_chr()` returns a character vector, 
- `map_dfr()`, `map_dfc()` returns a `data.frame`\
by binding rows or columns respectively.


## The map functions

Example: column-wise mean
```{r}
df <- tibble(a=rnorm(10), b=rnorm(10), c=rnorm(10), d=rnorm(10))
map_dbl(df, mean)                       # or equivalently: df %>% map_dbl(mean)   
```

Focus is on the operation being performed, not the book-keeping:

- `purrr` functions are implemented in C.
- the second argument, `.f`, can be a functions, a formula, 
a character vector, or an integer vector.

```{r}
map(1:3, ~ rnorm(7, .x))
```

## The map functions (2)

- `map` can pass additional parameters to the function

```{r}
map_dbl(df, mean, trim = 0.25)
```

- other inputs/outputs:

<div class="left" style="width: 50%">

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl)
```
</div>

<div class="right" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>%
  map_df(dim)
```
</div>




## Base-R maps vs. purrr maps

However, `purrr` is more consistent, so you should learn it.

A quick reference of similar base R functions:

- lapply is basically identical to map

- sapply is a wrapper around lapply and it tries to simplify the output. Downside: you
never know what you’ll get

- vapply: like sapply, but you can supply an additional argument that defines the type

# Handling missing values

## Missing values

Two types of missingness
```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)
```

The return for the fourth quarter of 2015 is **explicitly missing**

The return for the first quarter of 2016 is **implicitly missing**

The way that a dataset is represented can make implicit values explicit.

```{r}
stocks %>% spread(year, return)
```

## Gathering missing data

Recall the functions we learned from `tidyr` package.

You can used `spread()` and `gather()` to retain only non-missing recored,
i.e. to turn all explicit missing values into implicit ones.

```{r}
stocks %>% spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather(year, return, `2015`:`2016`, na.rm = TRUE)
```


## Completing missing data

`complete()` takes a set of columns, and finds all unique combinations. 
It then ensures the original dataset contains all those values, **filling 
in explicit `NA`s** where necessary.

```{r}
stocks %>% complete(year, qtr)
```

## Different intepretations of `NA`

Sometimes when a data source has primarily been used for data entry, missing
values indicate that the previous value should be carried forward:

```{r}
# tribble() constructs a tibble by filling by rows
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           10,
  NA,                 3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,           4
)
```


You can fill in these missing values with `fill()`

```{r}
treatment %>% fill(person)
```


# Merging datasets

## Relational data

- Rarely does a data analysis involve only a single table of data.

- Collectively, multiple tables of data are called **relational data** because 
the relations, not just the individual datasets, that are important.

- Relations are always defined between a pair of tables.

- All other relations are built up from this simple idea: the relations of three 
or more tables are always a property of the relations between each pair. 

## Example

the `nycflights13` package contains a collection of related datasets.

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```

## Keys

**A key** is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies 
an observation.

*For example, each plane is uniquely determined by its tailnum, but an 
observation in 'weather' is identified by five variables: `year, month, day`, 
`hour, and origin`*

**Keys** can be used to connect each pair of tables together.

There are two types of keys:

- **Primary:** identifies an observation in its own table. Example: 
`planes$tailnum`

- **Foreign:** identifies an observation in another table. Example: 
`flights$tailnum`, this is because `tailnum` does not enough to identify 
a record in `flights` dataset.

A variable can be both a primary key and a foreign key. 


## Identify primary keys

It’s good practice to verify that chosen keys do indeed uniquely 
identify each observation. 

One way to do that is to `count()` the primary keys and look for entries where
`n` is greater than one:

```{r}
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```


```{r}
weather %>% 
  count(year, month, day, hour, origin) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

## No primary key

Sometimes a table doesn’t have an explicit primary key, e.g. 
in `flights` dataset each row is an observation, but no combination of 
variables reliably identifies it, (even the flight numbers).

In this case, you can add an extra `identifier` column:

<div class="left" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(flight) %>% 
  filter(n > 1) 
```
</div>

<div class="right" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(flight_id= paste0("F", row_number())) %>%
  select(flight_id, year:flight)
```
</div>


## Merging two tables

There are three families of functions designed to merge relational data:

- **Mutating joins**, which add new variables to one data frame from matching 
observations in another.

- **Filtering joins**, which filter observations from one data frame based on 
whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

- **Set operations**, which treat observations as if they were set elements.

## Mutating joins

**A mutating join** allows you to combine variables from two tables,
by matching observations by their keys, and then copying across variables 
from one table to the other. e.g.

```{r}
flights %>%
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier) %>% 
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
```

## Mutating joins

There are four mutating join functions: 

- `inner_join()`

- outer joins;
    + `left_join()`
    + `right_join()`
    + `full_join()`


## A simple example

<div class="left" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     3, "x3"
)

y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     4, "y3"
)
```
</div>

<div class="right" style="width: 50%">

</div>


## Inner join


```{r}
x %>% inner_join(y, by = "key")
```

![](./Lecture5-figure/join-inner.png)
Source: (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)


## Outer join

<div class="left" style="width: 50%">
An outer join keeps observations that appear in at least one of the tables:

- A `left_join()` keeps all observations in the table on the left

- A `right_join()` keeps all observations in the table on the right

- A `full_join()` keeps all observations in both tables

## Duplicate keys

What happens when there are duplicate keys?

- One table has duplicate keys. There may be a one-to-many relation.
<img src="./Lecture5-figure/join-one-to-many.png", height="200"></img> 

- Both tables have duplicate keys. When you join duplicated keys, you get all 
possible combinations:

<small2>Source: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html</small2>


## Filtering joins

Filtering joins match observations in the same way as mutating joins, 
but affect the observations, not the variables. 

There are two types:

- `semi_join(x, y)` keeps all observations in x that have a match in y.
- `anti_join(x, y)` drops all observations in x that have a match in y.


<div class="left" style="width: 50%">
![](Lecture5-figure/join-semi.png)
</div>

<div class="right" style="width: 50%">
![](Lecture5-figure/join-anti.png)
</div>


## Multiple matches

In filtering joins, only the existence of a match is important.

It doesn’t matter which observation is matched.

Filtering joins never duplicate rows like mutating joins do:

![](./Lecture5-figure/join-semi-many.png)

## Set operations

Set operations apply to rows; they expect the `x` and `y` inputs to have 
the same variables, and treat the observations like sets.

- `intersect(x, y)`: returns only observations in both x and y.

- `union(x, y)`: returns unique observations in x and y.

- `setdiff(x, y)`: returns observations in x, but not in y.

All these operations work with a complete row, comparing the values of every
variable. 


## Example

<div class="left" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
df1 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,
   2,  1
)
df2 <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,
   1,  2
)
```

```{r}
intersect(df1, df2)
```
</div>

<div class="right" style="width: 50%">
```{r}
union(df1, df2)
setdiff(df1, df2)
setdiff(df2, df1)
```
</div>


# Data Export

## Exporting Data

After working with a dataset and doing all data manipulation, you might
want to save your new data table.

Recall the `readr` package. Besides functions for reading data in, `readr`
has utilities for **saving your data to a text file**:

```{r eval = FALSE}
write_tsv(mydata, "path/to/filename.tsv")                  # tab-delimited
write_csv(mydata, "path/to/filename.csv")                  # comma-delimited
write_delim(mydata, "path/to/filename.csv", delim = " ")   # general delimiter
```

To save your data in other types of files, you need to install and 
use other packages:

- to export an **Excel spreadsheet**, use `xlsx` package, and follow
this [guide](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-xlsx-package-a-quick-start-guide-to-manipulate-excel-files-in-r).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages(xlsx)
library(xlsx)
write.xlsx(mydata, "path/to/filename.xlsx")
```

- to export **SAS**, **SPSS** and **Stata** files use the 
[`haven` package](https://haven.tidyverse.org/).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages(haven)
library(haven)
read_sas("mtcars.sas7bdat")
write_sas(mtcars, "mtcars.sas7bdat")
```

## Saving the workspace

- You can also choose to **save all objects** currently in the workspace
(variables, functions, etc.) into a file e.g. `filename.rda`.
 
- The file `filename.rda` can be the easily loaded next time you work with R.

- You can also save a single object or a subset of specified
objects currently in the workspace.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# save the workspace to file 
save.image(file = "path/to/filename.rda")

# save specific objects to a file
save(object_list, file = "path/to/filename.rda")

# save just a single object
saveRDS(object, file = "path/to/filename.rds")
```

- Saved objects/workspace can be loaded back in a new R session.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# load a workspace into the current session
load("path/to/filename.rda")

# read just the previously saved 1 object
object <- readRDS("path/to/filename.rds")
```
